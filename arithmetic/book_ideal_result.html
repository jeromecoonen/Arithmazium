<h1>The ideal intermediate result</h1>

<p>
Floating point operations follow a
remarkably simple process, in principle:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Compute an <em>ideal</em> intermediate result,
    as if with unbounded range and precision.
  </li>
  <li>
    Coerce the intermediate result to fit within
    the destination.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
It's the fast, economical execution of
this perfectly logical process that poses challenges.
</p>

<p>
Of course, we don't really need unlimited precison in
the intermediate result. We need just enough
to provide a normalized (if possible), correctly-rounded
result.
</p>

<h2>An ideal intermediate</h2>
<p>
This diagram captures one way to produce
a correctly-rounded result.
</p>

<pre><med-code>  +---+---------------------+-------+
  | C | b &bull; b b b b . . . b | G R S |
  +---+---------------------+------ +
</med-code></pre>

<p>
The leading <em>Carry</em> bit catches a carry-out
that might, for example,
arise in magnitude addition of normalized
values.
</p>

<p>
The string of <code>b</code> bits represents the number
of significant bits
&ndash; the <em>precision</em> &ndash;
of the destination value.
The binary point here
is positioned after the leading significant bit, but
that's just a convention. The exponent, not shown,
aligns the binary point to its position in the mathematical
value.
</p>

<p>
<em>Guard</em> and <em>Round</em> are the next two 
bits beyond the rightmost <code>b</code>.
The <em>Sticky</em> bit is the logical sum of all bits
to the right or <em>Round</em>,
in the infinitely precise result.
The name &ldquo;sticky bit&rdquo; came into common usage during the development
of IEEE 754.
</p>

<p>
The <em>Sticky</em> bit provides the sense of
unbounded precision in the intermediate result.
It is <code>0</code> only if every bit to the right of
<em>Round</em> is <code>0</code>. If any righward bit
is <code>1</code>, then <em>Sticky</em> is <code>1</code>.
</p>

<p>
During <a class="inline" href="book_coercion.html">
Coercion</a>
of the result to the destination, we'll see
the roles these bits play.
</p>

<h2><code>add()</code> and <code>sub()</code></h2>

<p>
You can read about arithmetic on bytes in the
<a class="inline" href="../numbers/aaanumbers_toc.html">
Number Hall</a>.
Floating point <code>add()</code> and <code>sub()</code> are
made complicated by the shifting required to align the
binary points, and then the realignment during coercion. 
</p>

<p>
As a first example, let's compute \( 1 + 1 \).
No surprises here.
</p>

<pre><med-code>        1 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
      + 1 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
      -------------------
  +---+-------------------+-------+
  | 1 | 0 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | 0 0 0 |
  +---+-------------------+------ +
</med-code></pre>

<p>
Now let's try \( 1 + 2^{-99} \).
That lone <code>1</code> bit plays a role
later, when the value is rounded.
</p>

<pre><med-code>        1 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
      + 0 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 . . . 0 0 0 1
      -------------------------------------
  +---+-------------------+-------+
  | 0 | 1 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | 0 0 1 |
  +---+-------------------+------ +
</med-code></pre>

<p>
To see how cancellation works,
let's look at \( 1 - ( 1 - 2^{-8} ) \).
These are adjacent values in our 8-bit
number system.
</p>

<pre><med-code>        1 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
      - 0 &bull; 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
      ---------------------
  +---+-------------------+-------+
  | 0 | 0 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 | 1 0 0 |
  +---+-------------------+------ +
</med-code></pre>

<p>
The result requires an 8-bit left shift to be
normalized. Magnitude
subtraction of normalized numbers with the
same precision has interesting special cases.
Can you see that if the input values are more
than one bit out of alignment, the left
shift to renormalize is either zero or one bit?
Can you also see that when a when a larger shift
is required, that the result will require no
rounding? All of its rightmost bits are zero.
</p>

<h2><code>mul()</code></h2>

<p>
Floating point multiplication is a matter of computing
the product of the two 8-bit inputs, then gathering the
lowest bits into <em>Sticky</em>.
The multiplication can be seen as the binary
flavor of everyday long multiplication.
</p>

<p>
An example like \( ( 1 + 2^{-7} ) * ( 1 + 2^{-7} ) \)
spares us a blizzard of <code>1</code> bits.
The exact product is
\( 1 + 2^{-6} + 2^{-14} \)
where the tiny third term is collected into <em>Sticky</em>.
</p>

<pre><med-code>        1 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
      * 1 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
      -------------------
        0 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
             ...lines of zeros...
      + 1 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
      ---------------------------------
        1 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
  +---+-------------------+-------+
  | 0 | 1 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 | 0 0 1 |
  +---+-------------------+------ +
</med-code></pre>

<p>
If this is new to you, try a case like
\( ( 2 - 2^{-7} ) * ( 2 - 2^{-7} ) \).
As a big hint, here is the intermediate
result.
</p>

<pre><med-code>  +---+-------------------+-------+
  | 1 | 1 &bull; 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 | 0 0 1 |
  +---+-------------------+------ +
</med-code></pre>

<h2><code>div()</code></h2>

<p>
Floating point division can likewise be carried
out with the binary version of pencil-and-paper
long division. Fast implementations, including
the famous Pentium divide instruction, are discussed
outside this pamphlet.
The idea is to compute the quotient out to
at least the <em>Round</em> bit. Then, the
<em>Sticky</em> bit is <code>1</code> if there
is any nonzero remainder.
</p>

<p>
Let's look at \( ( 1 + 2^{-7} ) / ( 1 - 2^{-8} ) \),
the number just bigger than \( 1 \) divided by
the number just less than \( 1 \).
</p>

<div class="math">
  <p>
  The quotient is
  \[ ( 1 + 2^{-7} ) * ( 1 + 2^{-8} + 2^{-16} + 2^{-24} + \cdots ) \]
  which simplifies to
  \( 1 + 2^{-7} + 2^{-8} + 2^{-15} + 2^{-16} + \cdots \), with all the
  trailing terms absorbed into <em>Sitcky</em>.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
Most of the quotient bits are zero, so it's not too painful
to carry out this division by hand. In any case, the
ideal result appears as
</p>

<pre><med-code>  +---+-------------------+-------+
  | 0 | 1 &bull; 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 | 1 0 1 |
  +---+-------------------+------ +
</med-code></pre>

<h2><code>sqrt()</code> and <code>remainder()</code></h2>

<p>
The pencil-and-paper technique for extracting
a square root applies readily to binary
arithmetic, as shown in the
<a class="inline" href="../numbers/aaanumbers_toc.html">
Number Hall</a>.
As with division, the idea is to compute
the root out to
at least the <em>Round</em> bit. Then, the
<em>Sticky</em> bit is <code>1</code> if
the <em>radicand</em> has not been reduced
to zero.
</p>

<p>
The <code>remainder()</code> operation is different.
Its intermediate value is always exact, but the
number of integer quotient bits computed in order
to arrive at the remainder may be huge.
</p>


<h2>Logs, exponentials, trig functions</h2>

<p>
The previous sections have shown how the computational
model presented here, with its ideal intermediate result,
is mathematically feasible for the most common operations.
</p>

<p>
The situation for the <em>transcendental</em> functions
is more complicated, so the requirement for correctly-rounded
results rarely applies. Computing extra-precise intermediate
values may be too expensive. In any case, there is the
<em>Table-Maker's Dilemma:</em> that near half-way cases will arise,
requiring many extra significant bits to resolve. (See two papers
by W. Kahan in the Library, for example.)
