<h1>Numbers</h1>

<p>
Floating point numbers fall neatly into a
parallelogram.
A bullet &bull;
emphasizes the binary point in this 8-bit
number system. Each value may have positive
or negative algebraic sign.

</code></pre>

<p>
This is a <em>normalized</em> number system.
The leading bit is <code>1</code>,
except perhaps for the tiniest values. 
</p>

<p>
Normalization ensures there is exactly one representation for
any value.
For example, two appears as
<code>10.000000</code> in the table, and nowhere else.
When it's time to encode numbers as bit strings
in memory,
normalization gives us a free bit. If we know the
leading significant bit is <code>1</code>, we don't have
to store it.
</p>

<p>
The diagram suggests the sense in which the binary point
<em>floats</em> left and right across 8-bit strings.
Usually, there is a limit to how far rightward the binary
point can float &ndash; a limit to how big numbers can get.
That largest representable number is called the
<em>overflow threshold</em>.
</p>

<p>
In the same way,there is a limit to how far leftward
the binary point can float &ndash; a limit to how tiny
numbers can get. The diagram shows a tiniest normalized
number. This may be called the <em>underflow threshold</em>.
</p>

<p>
The diagram suggests that we may squeeze out a bit more range
by allowing the leading bit to go to <code>0</code> for just
these tiniest numbers. The IEEE 754 Floating Point Standard
famously adopted such <em>denormalization</em> as a means to
mitigate the effects of underflow. The resulting values have
come to be called <em>subnormal</em>.
</p>

<p>
The 8-bit numbers fit conveniently in a diagram.
The narrow values help convey the dynamic nature of
floating point numbers. Please don't think it's a toy
example. Every day, billions of such numbers play into
artificial intelligence calculations carried out by
specialized processors.
