<h1>Special floating point values</h1>

<p>
Modern floating point systems have three
flavors of special value. All of them have
roots extending back to the mainframes of the
sixties and beyond and even the pioneering computers
that preceded them.
</p>

<h2>Zero</h2>

<p>
The parallelogram diagram misses one crtical value, zero,
which figures specially in nearly every operation.
The only question is whether zero carries algebraic sign.
IEEE 754 specifies signed zero.
</p>

<p>
The sign of zero requires special definition in the
arithmetic, because mathematical zero has no sign.
For signed zero to be sensible mathematically,
\( -0 = +0 \) must be true, as must \( x \pm 0 = x \)
and many other identities.
It is \( x / \pm0 \) for \( x \neq 0 \) that brings
out the sign of zero.
</p>

<h2>Infinity</h2>

<p>
Modern floating point systems define some form of \( \infty \).
IEEE 754 specifies \( \pm \infty \), not just as the
reciprocal of \( \pm 0 \), but also to cope with values
just too big to represent as normal numbers.
Infinity helps cope with results that fall beyond
the overflow threshold.
</p>

<p>
\[ \pm \infty = \pm 1 / \pm 0 \]
where the usual conventions for algebaric sign apply.
</p>

<h2>NaN</h2>

<p>
The Not-a-Number symbol, or NaN, is the last resort, when
no numerical value, even infinite, makes sense.
The expression \( \pm 0 / \pm 0 \) is just one.
At least \( \sqrt{-5} \) has a mathematical meaning,
but it has no representation in a number system with just
real values. NaNs can but be stored for missing data
in a data set or used to initialze numerical values
created while a program is running.
</p>

<p>
Modern programming languages define entities like
<code>null</code>, <code>None</code>, or <code>undefined</code>
to cope with edge cases of all kinds. For a number
system to be meaningful across diverse language
environments and for it to be possible to encode
unusual values in a portable bit format, some
general form of NaN is required. IEEE 754 specified
its NaNs over 40 years ago, to work as seamlessly
as possible in more primitive high level languages.
