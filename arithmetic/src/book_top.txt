<h1>Floating point essentials</h1>

<p>
This pamphlet presents binary floating point
number systems and special
values. You will see how arithmetic operations
produce results within the number system.
You will see how the arithmetic connects to the
rest of the computer system.
You will see what happens the edges, where
floating point departs from everyday mathematics.
</p>

<p>
The presentation is in binary, but the ideas apply
directly to octal, decimal, and hexadecimal.
The presentation covers one
data type, but discusses the case of
supporting multiple types.
</p>

<p>
The key simplification is the omission of the storage
format. How the bits are arranged in storage is a vital
part of the design, but the details of encoding have
nothing to do with the acutal arithmetic.
You will find extensive
discussion of number encodings elsewhere than this pamphlet.
