<h1>Welcome to the Arithmazium!</h1>
  <p>
    This site tells a story of computer arithmetic. The target audience is
    anyone age 5 to 75. Undergraduate students will find useful lore here
    that is rarely found in any curriculum.
    Arithmazium strives to be
    engaging rather than encyclopedic.
    The site offers bits even
    the most devoted experts might enjoy.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can always return to the home page by clicking the
    blue Arithmazium banner.
  </p>

<h2>Disclosures and other fine print</h2>
  <p>
    As of mid-year 2020, this site is very much under construction.
    So long as it's not a distraction at this early stage,
    Arithmazium will remain open.
    What you see is what you get, and
    all the usual legal Latin applies: <em>caveat emptor</em> and <em>tempis
    fugits</em>, hopefully with a dash of <em>compos mentis</em>.
  </p>
<h2>Reader's guide</h2>
  <p>
    You need no more than enthusiasm to approach Arithmazium.
    The site presents many stories, not a tsunami of facts.
    Arithmetic is the subject. You need just elementary
    mathematics to get a long way down the path.
  </p>

  <div class="math">
  <p>
    When optional mathematical content arises to enrich the story,
    it is highlighted like this. But Arithmazium is self-contained
    without readers poring over every fantastic formula like
    \[4/3 = 1 + 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + 1/1024 + \cdots\]
    so please feel free to skim or skip the math.
  </p>
  </div>

    Of course, computer arithmetic is exploited through programming,
    but you won't need sophisticated programming knowledge to follow
    the thread. Literally, many of the code samples you'll see are variations
    on a simple theme:
  <pre><code>
    new_value = old_value / TWO
  </code></pre>
    The patience to read such formulas and to follow the binary bits
    or decimal digits where they fall is all you need.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're 5 and reading this, you don't need my guidance.
    If you're with a young person or you miraculously find yourself
    here without having encountered computer arithmetic before,
    go to the
    <a href="aaaplayroom_toc.html">Playroom</a>,
    scheduled to open Fall 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, your next step is to the
    <a href="../paranoia/aaapara_toc.html">
      Paranoia Study
    </a>
    to ponder a rich stew of arithmetic delights collected in a
    cult-classic program.
