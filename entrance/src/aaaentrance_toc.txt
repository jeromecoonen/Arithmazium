<h1>Welcome to the Arithmazium</h1>

<h2>Let's go!</h2>
  <p>
    To skip this introduction, jump right to the
    <a href="../numbers/aaanumbers_toc.html">Number Hall</a>
    to start from square one.
    Just follow the <em>Next</em> buttons from there.
  </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This site tells a story of computer arithmetic.
    There should be something of interest to
    anyone over the age of 5.
    Undergraduate students will find useful lore here
    rarely found in any college curriculum.
    Younger students might enjoy a computer's point of
    view on their everyday computation.
    Or they might get a sense of how
    the processors in game devices and graphics
    cards perform blazingly fast
    rendering and simulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Arithmazium tries to be
    engaging not encyclopedic.
    Even the most devoted experts should
    find something to enjoy.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can always return to the home floor plan by clicking the
    blue Arithmazium banner.
  </p>

<h2>Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    In spring 2021, this site is very much under construction.
    So long as that is not a distraction,
    Arithmazium will remain open.
    What you see is what you get, and
    all the usual legal Latin applies: <em>caveat emptor</em>
    and <em>tempis fugits</em>, hopefully with a dash of
    <em>compos mentis</em>.
  </p>

<h2>Reader's guide</h2>
  <p>
    You need no more than enthusiasm to approach Arithmazium.
    The site presents many stories, not a tsunami of facts.
    Computer arithmetic is the subject. Elementary
    mathematics will get you a long way down the path.
  </p>

  <div class="math">
  <p>
    When optional mathematical content arises to enrich the story,
    it is highlighted like this. But you need not
    pore over every fantastic formula like
    \[4/3 = 1 + 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + 1/1024 + \cdots\]
    to benefit from Arithmazium.
    Please feel free to skim or skip the math.
  </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Of course, computer arithmetic is exploited through programming,
    but you won't need sophisticated programming knowledge to follow
    along. Literally, many of the code samples you'll see are variations
    on a simple theme:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    new_value = old_value / TWO
  </code></pre>
    The patience to read such formulas and to follow the binary bits
    or decimal digits where they fall is all you need.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're 5 and reading this, blaze on.
    You don't need my guidance.
    If you're with a young person or just wish to
    revel in the bits,
    head to the
    <a href="../numbers/aaanumbers_toc.html">Number Hall</a>
    to get started.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you are ready to dig into floating point arithmetic
    and related topics, visit the
    <a href="../arithmetic/aaaarithmetic_toc.html">
    Arithmetic Study</a>.
    This is the heart of the matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are an expert interested in a dose
    of floating point lore, or if you're just
    feeling lucky, try the
    <a href="../paranoia/aaapara_toc.html">
    Paranoia Lab</a>.
    You will find a
    <em>semiliterate programming</em> dissection of
    Prof. William Kahan's cult classic Paranoia code.
  </p>

  <p>
    For something a bit off the beaten path,
    you can read a bit about
    <a href="../library/aaacontinued_fractions_toc.html">
    continued fractions</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Arithmazium can't hope to tell the whole story.
    For that, you need the
    <a href="../library/aaaalibrary_toc.html">
    Library</a>,
    where you will find a collection of supporting
    papers and technical manuals.
  </p>

  <p>
    When all else fails, there's always the
    <a href="../mailroom/aaamailroom_toc.html">
    Mail Room</a>.
    Read the FAQs. Leave a comment.
