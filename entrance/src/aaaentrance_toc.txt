<h1>Welcome to the Arithmazium</h1>

<h2>Let's go!</h2>
  <p>
    To skip this introduction, jump right to the
    <a href="../numbers/aaanumbers_toc.html">Number Hall</a>
    to start from square one.
    Just follow the <em>Next</em> buttons from there.
  </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This site tells a story of computer arithmetic.
    There should be something of interest to
    anyone over the age of 5.
    Undergraduate students will find useful lore here
    rarely found in any college curriculum.
    Younger students might enjoy a computer's point of
    view on their everyday computation.
    Or they might get a sense of how blazingly fast
    rendering and simulation is carried out./
    Arithmazium strives to be
    engaging rather than encyclopedic.
    Even the most devoted experts will
    find something to enjoy.

    You can always return to the home floor plan by clicking the
    blue Arithmazium banner.

<h2>Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    In early 2021, this site is very much under construction.
    So long as that is not a distraction,
    Arithmazium will remain open.
    What you see is what you get, and
    all the usual legal Latin applies: <em>caveat emptor</em>
    and <em>tempis fugits</em>, hopefully with a dash of
    <em>compos mentis</em>.
  </p>
<h2>Reader's guide</h2>
  <p>
    You need no more than enthusiasm to approach Arithmazium.
    The site presents many stories, not a tsunami of facts.
    Computer arithmetic is the subject. Elementary
    mathematics will get you a long way down the path.
  </p>

  <div class="math">
  <p>
    When optional mathematical content arises to enrich the story,
    it is highlighted like this. But you need not
    pore over every fantastic formula like
    \[4/3 = 1 + 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + 1/1024 + \cdots\]
    to benefit from Arithmazium.
    Please feel free to skim or skip the math.
  </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Of course, computer arithmetic is exploited through programming,
    but you won't need sophisticated programming knowledge to follow
    the thread. Literally, many of the code samples you'll see are variations
    on a simple theme:
  </p>
  <pre><code>
    new_value = old_value / TWO
  </code></pre>
    The patience to read such formulas and to follow the binary bits
    or decimal digits where they fall is all you need.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're 5 and reading this, blaze on.
    You don't need my guidance.
    If you're with a young person or just wish to
    revel in the bits,
    heat to the
    <a href="../numbers/aaanumbers_toc.html">Den of Numbers</a>
    to get started.
