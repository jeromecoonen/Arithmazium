Impllementation status as of 2021
---------------------------------

Servers, workstations, laptops, phones – designs by Intel, AMD, Arm, Mips, and RISC V support 754.

GPUs – Nvidia processors use a 16-bit half-float type "recommended" in current 754, along with support for 64-bit float.

Machine Learning – proprietary Google chips use the bfloat16 type inspired by 754 32-bit single format.

DSPs – STM, for one, supplies parts less than $1, based on Arm cores with 754 floating point arithmetic.

Supercomputers -- based on high-end server CPUs, all with IEEE 754 arithmetic.
