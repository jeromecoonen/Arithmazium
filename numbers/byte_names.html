<h1>How we name numbers</h1>

<p>
We are so familiar with numbers from everyday use
that we rarely ponder the underlying
mathematical view.
That view is useful for our understanding
of numbers in computers.
</p>

<p>
When we talk about the numbers zero through twelve,
a mathematician might conjure up an image like this.
</p>

</object>

<p>
The concept of <em>number</em> is tied to counting
collections of things. The container doesn't matter,
just the collection.
When we match the eggs in a carton one-for-one with the
boxes in the lsat group above,
we say they have the <em>same number</em>.
Then we can match them one-for-one
with the donuts in a box.
</p>

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="img/number_12.svg">

<p>
The concept of number is about
quantity. It doesn't depend on names for the quantities.
We call this number <em>twelve</em>
or sometimes <em>a dozen</em>, but it has other names.
The expression \( 12 \) is another name.
</p>

<p>
If you're careful with your laundry,
when you look in your sock drawwer, your socks
are in pairs matching this collection:

<h2>Names for numbers</h2>

<p>
It is an accident of our biology that we use decimal
numbers to name quantities. Our ancestors counted on
their fingers long before it was forbidden in school.
</p>

<p>
Computers work best with binary numbers.
They can quickly and reliably detect the presence of
voltage, which they associate with <code>1</code>,
or the absence of voltage, which signifies <code>0</code>.
Just zero and one. Back when computers
were huge and intimidating, people joked about
how stupid they were. No doubt, part of that was due
to a number system with just two digits.
</p>

<p>
From an early age,
we hear about the ones place, the tens place, and so
on. The very same concept applies to binary
numbers. It just works a little slower.
In binary, we have the ones place, the twos place, the
fours place, the eights place, the sixteens place, the
thirty-twos place, and so on. We're out of breath before
we reach the one-hundred-twenty-eights place.
</p>

<p>
But, wait, we're using our handy decimal numbers to talk
about the binary world. That's the point of the number boxes
earlier. The number is what matters, not its name. We often
use decimal language in human communication,
even talking about binary arithmetic. But, when we
talk to a computer about bytes, binary is best.
</p>

<h2>The basic formula</h2>

<p>
Let's look at the number \( 197 \). Somewhere along the way,
we learned to decompose the number as
\[ 197 = 1 \times 10^{2} + 9 \times 10^{1} + 7 \times 10^{0} \]
The expression here emphasizes the powers of ten.
</p>

<div class="math">
<p>
From the byte odometer on the last page,
we learn that \( 197 \) can be
written as <code>11000101</code>.
The breakdown into binary is
\[ 197 = 11000101_{2} = 2^{7} + 2^{6} + 2^{2} + 2^{0} \]
</p>
</div>

<p>
Returning to the dozen donuts we didn't eat earlier,
we see that our number 12 when stored in a byte
has the form <code>00001100</code> because
\( 12 = 8 + 4 \). More names for the same number.
</p>

<p>
Now it's time to do some byte arithmetic.
