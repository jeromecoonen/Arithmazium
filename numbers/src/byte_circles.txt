<h1>Running in circles</h1>

<p>
Numbers in computer registers do not simply grow as we
increase them. Instead, they run in circles.
When they reach a maximum value, <code>11111111</code>
in the case of the byte, they <em>wrap arount</em> to zero.
</p>

<p>
As you manipulate the slider below, which runs faster
than the first example, think of the values running
around the circle shown. Adding one moves us counterclockwise,
and subtracting one move us clockwise.

 The byte has the value

What's wrong with this picture? The byte should be shown to its full eight bits, including leading zeros. This is a bug to be fixed.

<p>
We should not be shocked by this behavior of byte registers
in computers. We see it every day on our clocks, which wrap
around every 12 hours on most U.S. clocks and every 24 hours
on any clock. Especially on older cars with mechanical
odometers, it's exciting to see the mileage <em>99,999.9</em>
roll over to <em>00,000.0</em>

<div class="math">
<p>
In the previous sections on basic byte arithmetic,
we introduced the concept of <em>modular arithmetic</em>.
In basic byte arithmetic, all operations are performed
modulo \( 256 \). When the computer lops off all bits
beyond the 8 bits of a byte, it effective removes all
multiples of \( 256 \), reducing the value to the range
\( 0 \) to \( 255 \).
