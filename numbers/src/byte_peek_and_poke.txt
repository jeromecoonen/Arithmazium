<h1>Peek and poke</h1>

<p>
No discussion of the basics of bytes is complete
without mention of the classic functions
<code>PEEK</code> and <code>POKE</code>.
</p>

<p>
These functions are not aritheitc, but
they were staples of early BASIC language
systems on the classic personal computers
like the Apple ][ and the IBM PC.
</p>

<p>
When computers shipped with 4KB of RAM &ndash that's
4,096 bytes &ndash; every byte mattered.
<code>PEEK(37)</code> on an Apple ][
returns the vertical postion of the cursor,
a number between \( 1 \) and \( 24 \).
<code>POKE(82,128)</code> puts the Apple ][ in
a state where it will <em>auto-run</em> a
program from a cassette tape when the tape
is loaded.
</p>

<p>
Computers used to be very personal.
Users had access to every single byte.
