<h1>Subtraction</h1>

<p>
The interesting case in binary subtraction is
</p>

<pre><xbig-code>  0 - 1  =  1 with borrow
</xbig-code></pre>

<p>
The subtraction table has the added wrinkle that
<code>0 - 1</code> triggers a borrow from the bit
position to the left. In elementary
school, borrowing is challenging for some students.
Imagine the school mantra applied to \( 25 - 7 \):
"Five minus seven becomes fifteen minus seven
by borrowing ten from the next subtrahend digit to the left, 
reducing it by one." Out comes \( 18 \)!
</p>

<p>
When we reach left one bit position to borrow, we get
\( 2 \), or <code>10</code> in binary.
</p>

<pre><big-code>  -|  0   1
  -+-------
  0|  0  b1    1 with  borrow
  1|  1   0
</code></pre>

<p>
Later on, we will look at another way to subtract,
but it's useful to carry the operation out in our
paper-and-pencil manner to get a feel for binary
operations.
Each <code>b</code> indicates a borrow from that
bit position.
</p>

<pre><big-code>
      bbbbb
    01100100      100
  - 00001101     - 13
  ----------     ----
    01010111       87
</code></pre>

<p>
You might be thinking that anyone can subtract
\( 13 \) from \( 100 \). But how about the other way around?
It's just more subtract-with-borrow, with the extra twist
that we get a free borrow from beyond the leftmost
bit, if needed. Here it is:
</p>

<pre><big-code>   bbb   
    00001101       13
  - 01100100     -100
  ----------     ----
    10101001      169    = 256 - 87
</code></pre>

<p>
When we borrow from the left,
it is as though we have added \( 2^{8} = 256 \)
to the result. What
mathematically ought
to be \( -87 \) is actually
\( 256 - 87 = 169 \) or
<code>01010001</code> in
the byte.
</p>

<p>
We'll see in the later pages how 
easy it is to have negative numbers in bytes, too.
