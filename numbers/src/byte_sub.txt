<h1>Byte subtraction</h1>

<p>
The interesting case in binary subtraction is
</p>

<pre><xbig-code>  0 - 1  =  1 with borrow
</xbig-code></pre>

<p>
The subtraction table has the added wrinkle that
<code>0 - 1</code> triggers a borrow from the bit
position to the left. In elementary
school, borrowing is challenging for some students.
Its mantra is baffling, unless you already understand
how to do it: "five minus seven is two, borrow one by
crossing out the next left subtrahend digit and 
reducing it by one." Simple!
</p>

<pre><big-code>  -|  0   1
  -+-------
  0|  0  b1    1 with  borrow
  1|  1   0
</code></pre>

<p>
Later on, we will look at another way to subtract,
but it's useful to carry the operation out in our
paper-and-pencil manner to get a feel for binary
operations.
Each <code>b</code> indicates a borrow from that
bit position.
</p>

<pre><big-code>      bbbbbb
    01100100      100
  - 00001101     - 13
  ----------     ----
    01010111       87
</code></pre>

<p>
Of course, you are thinking that anyone can subtract
\( 13 \) from \( 100 \). But how about the other way around?
It's just more subtract-with-borrow, with the extra twist
that we get a <em>free borrow</em> from beyond the leftmost
bit, if needed. Here it is.
</p>

<pre><big-code>    00001101       13
  - 01100100     -100
  ----------     ----
    01010001      169    = 256 - 87
</code></pre>

<p>
The free borrow has the effect of adding \( 2^{8} = 256 \)
to the result. What
mathematically ought
to be \( -87 \) is actutally <code>01010001</code> in
the byte, or \( 169 \).
</p>

<p>
We'll see in the next pages how conveniently binary arithmetic can handle
negative numbers.
