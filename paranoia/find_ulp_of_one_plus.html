<h1>find_ulp_of_one_plus()</h1>

<p>
This innocent-looking function features two
splendid numerical idioms of Paranoia, one in this section, one in the next.
</p>

<p>
The task is simple enough. In a six-digit decimal system, the value of 
the an ulp of <code>1.0</code> is just \(10 ^ {-5}\).
</p>

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="img/6_digit_ulp-auto.svg">
  ------Image------
</object>

<p>
The value is easily obtained by a look at the specification of the
number system. In the IEEE 754 single format with 24 significant
bits, an ulp of one is \(2 ^ {-23}\).
</p>

<p>
Actually <em>computing</em> an ulp of <code>1.0</code> without knowledge of the radix
or precision is another matter. Our strategy is to compute
\(1 / 3\) or \(2 / 3\) of an ulp <em>exactly</em> and then triple
the value. This guarantees we have <em>exactly</em> one or
two ulps of <code>1.0</code>. Poor arithmetic
may give us several extra ulps, but that's no problem.
In the second half of the function we'll walk down to exactly
one ulp.
</p>

<p>
We start with the value \(4 / 3\). We know the decimal expression
\(1.3333\cdots\) and in a moment we'll see that the value in binary is
\(1.010101\cdots _{2}\). The value must round in any
radix not a multiple of \(3\).
</p>

<p>
What matters is that the rounding error is one or two thirds of an ulp
of <code>1.0</code>, perhaps plus one or more further ulps of
<code>1.0</code> if the division
is especially sloppy. To see this, look at the decimal number line:
</p>

</object>

<p>
The tick marks signify the (highly magnified)
representable numbers in each <em>decade</em>.
Their spacing defines ulps of the leftward bounding
power of \(10\), which is \(1.0\) here.
The rounding error
in <code>4.0 / 3.0</code> is at least \(0.3333\cdots\)
or \(0.6666\cdots\)
ulp of <code>1.0</code>, depending on which representable
value is computed.
</p>

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="img/ulp_one_plus_4_3_d-auto.svg">
  4/3 rounded in decimal
</object>

<p>
Any addtional error is in whole ulps.
In decimal, the error is \(-1 / 3, -4 / 3, -7 / 3, \ldots\)
or \(+2 / 3, +5 / 3, +8 / 3, \ldots\)
ulps of <code>1.0</code>.
That is, there's a guaranteed one or two thirds ulp in the rounding error.
The same logic applies to binary, octal, and hex arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
After <code>4.0 / 3.0</code> is rounded, the rest of the setup is done
in what should be exact arithmetic. The one or two thirds
of an ulp error are baked into the following exact calculations.
Subtracting <code>1.0</code> is exact, leaving the variable
<code>third</code> with the value
\(1/3 + \epsilon\).
This remarkable value captures two interesting but unrepresentable
numbers in one machine number. We know that \(\epsilon\) is
exactly \(1 / 3\) of an ulp of <code>1.0</code>, perhaps with
additional ulps.

</p>

<p>
The first numerical trick featured in this function
is the use of artful cancellation
to isolate \(\epsilon\) and triple
it, giving us our ulp of <code>1.0</code>, exactly.
</p>

<p>
The value <code>third</code> lies in the range of numbers
just less than <code>1.0</code>, where the numbers are <code>B</code>
times as dense as just above <code>1.0</code>. Our next operations
will be exact. The code computes the value
<code>x</code> given exactly by
\[ | (1/2 - (1/3 + \epsilon) \times 2) - (1/3 + \epsilon) | \]
which simplifies to \( | 3 \epsilon |\).
We have isolated and tripled \(\epsilon\).
The value <code>x</code> is a
small number of ulps of <code>1.0</code>, exactly.
</p>

<p>
The diagram below shows the case of binary arithmetic
with an even number of bits.
Note the fun fact that in this case, unlike decimal,
the nereast value to \(4 / 3\) is gotten
by rounding up \(1 / 3\) of an ulp.
The lowest-order bits of values are not shown as the subtractions proceed.
They're all zero, by design, in this isolation of the ulps of <code>1.0</code>.

<div class="math">
<p>
This section gives some optional mathematical elaboration.
We rewrite \(4/3\) to expand it in binary.
\[
4/3 = {1 \over {1 - {1/4}}} = 1 + 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + \cdots
\]
which is the binary expression \(1.010101... _{2}\) above.
</p>

<p>
Similary, we rearrange \(4/3\) to the form
\[
4/3 = -2 + 3 \times 10/9 = - 2 + 3 \times {1 \over {1 - {1/10}}} =
1 + 3/10 + 3/100 + \cdots 
\]
which gives the familiar expansion
\(1.3333\cdots\) in decimal.
</p>

<p>
While we're here, we can observe
that \(3 \times 0.3333\cdots = 0.9999\cdots\) has
the value \(1\), which can cause comfusion on decimal calculators
with finite precision. In the spirit of the previous examples,
we write \(1 = 9/10 \times 10/9\) and expand
\[
10/9 = {1 \over {1 - 1/10}} = 1.1111\cdots
\]
So \(1 = 9/10 \times 1.1111\cdots = 0.9999\cdots\)
as expected from \(3 \times 1/3\).
</p>
</div>

<p>
The code chooses the larger of the computation and the
input guess, trusting the iteration to drive down to just
one ulp.
</p>

<pre><code>def find_ulp_of_one_plus(guess):
    """Compute u such at 1+u is the next larger value than 1."""
    x = FOUR / THREE    # rounds in ulps of 1
    third = x - ONE
    sixth = ONE_HALF - third
    x = sixth + sixth
    x = fabs(x - third)   # sums two rounding errors
    if x < guess:
        x = guess
    # Now x = (unknown no.) ulps of 1+.
</code></pre>

<p>
The code continues in the next section.
</p>

<h2>Your turn</h2>

<p>
<span class="exer">Exercise:</span> Replay the binary case with odd
precision to see that
it also proudces an ulp of <code>1.0</code>.
