<h1>Pocket Guide to Python for Paranoia</h1>
<p>
Paranoia is a complex program with a simple structure â€“
a single sequence of computations with results displayed at each
step. <span class="p">ParaPy</span> breaks the in-line
form of <span class="p">ParaBas</span> into dozens of independent
functions, but the flow of execution is the same.
</p>

<p>
The structure of <span class="p">ParaPy</span> and the clean
form of Python make this code as readable as any
<em>pseudocode</em>, but this section presents a small
number of Python's features you might find helpful.
The focus is on what matters for Paranoia, not the
juicy details of Python exploited to its fullest.
</p>

</p>

<h3>Values, not types</h3>
<p>
Python is untyped. Variables arise from use rather than
by declaration. Python supports integers of arbitrary
size, but <span class="p">ParaPy</span> uses floating
point values for its tests. If you're using any conventional
computer (or cloud-based server) from the past four decades,
you're likely to have IEEE Standard 754 64-bit
<code>double</code> values. You can find
intimate details of IEEE 754 arithmetic
in the
<a class="inline" href="../essentials/aaaessentials_toc.html">
Essentials</a> room.
</p>

<p>
Python supports the boolean values <code>True</code>
and <code>False</code>, and an intuitive definition
of <em>truthiness</em> as anything remotely nonzero.
</p>

<p>
Strings in <span class="p">ParaPy</span> usually
appear in <code>"double quotes"</code>, but may
also be written with <code>'single quotes'</code>.
</p>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>
The hash sign <code>#</code> not embedded in a string
introduces a comment
that runs to the end of the line.
</p>

<p>
Python also supports <em>docstrings</em>, triple-quoted
comments you'll find as the first line(s) of most
functions.
</p>

<pre><code>  def print_if_err_cnt_positive():
      '''Print an error message from a global count.'''
</code></pre>

<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>
A function
can take any number of parameters and return and
number of values.
This is another example from
<span class="p">ParaPy</span>, including the one-line docstring.
</p>

<pre><code>  def compute_H_and_inverse():
      """Return min(1/B, 1/2) and reciprocal, noting H is a fraction."""
</code></pre>

<p>
The return mechanism is coming right up.
</p>

<h3>Block structure</h3>
<p>
Python's most remarkable feature is its approach to punctuation.
Indented lines of code are blocks, usually introduced with a
<code>:</code> character. Here is the body of
<code>compute_H_and_inverse()</code> from the last section.
It is indented one level in (typically 4 spaces) from the <code>def</code>.
</p>

<pre><code>    if B < TWO:
        h_inv = TWO
    else:
        h_inv = B
</code></pre>

<p>
Locally, the indentation is very readable. When the plot thickens
and you find yourself several levels deep in the logic,
it takes a steady eye, or a plumb line, to keep oriented.
<span class="p">ParaPy</span> reaches its deepest nesting in
the examination of <em>underflow</em>, which may not surprise
readers who have been down this path before.
</p>

<h3>Tuples</h3>
<p>
Part of Python's expressiveness is its
ability to manipulate multiple values at a time.
The final line of
<code>compute_H_and_inverse()</code> is the return
of <code>H</code> and its reciprocal:
</p>

<pre><code>    return ONE / h_inv, h_inv
</code></pre>

<p>
You can guess that the invocation assigns two results.
</p>

<pre><code>  H, ONE_OVER_H = compute_H_and_inverse()
</code></pre>

<p>
Python tuples are defined as values grouped by parentheses,
but the <em>Pythonic</em> way is to relax the requirement
for the punctuation
when the context is obvious. Tuples are likewise useful in loops,
where two or more values are updated at each pass.
</p>

<h3>Global variables</h3>
<p>
Basic on the 1982 IBM Personal Computer was limited by
its flat structure and its limited namespace for variables.
All variables were global, of the form
<code>A</code> or <code>X3</code>, making the glossary
at the end of <span class="p">ParaBas</span> essential reading.
Reuse of some variables in different sections of the code
could complicate things for the reader.
</p>

<p>
<span class="p">ParaPy</span> uses Python global variables sparingly,
always in a way parallel to <span class="p">ParaBas</span>.
One class of globals, the flags and counters, are defined and initialized
at the beginning of the code.
</p>

<p>
The other globals are constants, distinguished by their all-caps
names. They are assigned once, then used as needed. Two exceptions,
radix <code>B</code> and <code>PRECISION</code>, are double-checked
and are subject to update.
</p>

<p>
When a global variable is assigned within a function it must
be declared <code>global</code>, otherwise a local variable
is created.
For example, the <code>pause()</code> function accesses two
globals.

<pre><code>  def pause():
      """Wait until the user hits RETURN."""
      global milestone, page_num
</code></pre>

<h3>Style</h3>
<p>
<span class="p">ParaPy</span> generally follows the
<a class="inline"
  href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html">
  Google style guide</a>.
As just noted, constant variables like
<code>ONE_HALF</code> are upper case.
All other variables and all functions are lower case
with underscore dividers, like
<code>underflow_threshold</code>.
</p>

<h3>An idiom for do-while</h3>
<p>
The Pythonic approach is to support
one way, not four, to accomplish a task.
Python supports <code>while</code> loops, whose condition is tested
at the top of the loop. <span class="p">ParaBas</span> employs the
alternative
<code>do...while</code> structure heavily, in which the condition is
tested at the end of the loop.
</p>

<p>
<span class="p">ParaPy</span> effects this structure with a mild
deviation from the style guide.
Bringing the loop <code>break</code> statement up alongside the
<code>if</code> test improves readability.
</p>

<pre><code>    y = ONE
    while True:
        b = big + y
        y = y + y
        b = b - big
        if b != ZERO: break
</code></pre>

<h3>Modules and libraries</h3>
<p>
<span class="p">ParaPy</span> has a simple structure
that fits in a single file (module), so there's no need
for elaboration. At the top of the code, it <em>imports</em>
the <code>math</code> library, giving access to handy
functions like <code>math.sqrt</code> and
<code>math.pow</code>.
</p>

<p>
The curious line
</p>

<pre><code>  from __future__ import division      # use // for integer division
</code></pre>

<p>
is a bit of Python custom around the <code>/</code> operator
as it applies to integers. We'll do nothing subtle with integer
division.
</p>

<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>
A Python list is an ordered sequence of values. In
<span class="p">ParaPy</span>, we sometimes iterate
over a list, as in this case of small odd primes:
</p>

<pre><code>    for z in [3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]:
</code></pre>


<h3>Dictionaries</h3>
<p>
A Python dictionary is a set of <em>key-value</em> pairs.
<span class="p">ParaPy</span> has just one dictionary, a global
set of test results. This is the start of its defiinition.
</p>

<pre><code>  flags = {
      "mult_guard_digit": False,
      "div_guard_digit": False,
</code></pre>

<p>
The construct <code>flags["mult_guard_digit"]</code> accesses
the dictionary element.
</p>

<h3>Number formatting</h3>
<p>
If you have formatted floating point numbers in another language,
Python will come as no surprise. This is a typical usage.
</p>

<pre><code>    print("\tdiffers from z * 1 = {:0.17e}".format(r1))
</code></pre>

<p>
Format requests in <code>{...}</code> are fulfilled in
sequence from the arguments to <code>format</code>.
As in C, <code>\t</code> skips to the next
tab stop, and <code>\n</code> skips to the next line.
The <code>.17e</code> requests 17 significant digits
in the exponential format.
