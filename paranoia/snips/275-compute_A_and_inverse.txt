def compute_A_and_inverse(radix):
    """Return value for constants A and ONE_OVER_A, based on radix.

    a is 2 if radix is 1 (logarithmic) or a  power of 2.
    a is 10 if radix is a power of 10. Otherwise a is the radix.
    There are two tests that "a" behaves well in division.

        radix: passed from B

    Returns:
        a, 1 / a
