def compute_A_and_inverse(radix):
    """Return value for constants A and ONE_OVER_A, based on radix.

    a is 2 if radix is 1 (***logarithmic?) or a  power of 2.
    a is 10 if radix is a power of 10. Otherwise a is the radix.
    There are two tests that value "a" behaves well in division.

    Args:
        radix -- usually passed from B

    Returns:
        a, 1 / a
