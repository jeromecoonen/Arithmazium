def compute_C_and_inverse():
    """Return untility constant C = 1 / B**k, safely above the underflow
    threshold, and its reciprocal.

    C is a useful starting point for investigation of underflow.
    It has the form 1 / B**k with k chosen so that C is farther than
    a factor of 1 / B**PRECISION of underflowing to zero.
    C is a normal number. It's reciprocal is a large power of B.

    Returns:
        C, 1 / C
