def compute_safe_ulps_of_one():
    """Return a value useful in underflow and square root testing.

    Given the constant C, a power of B not far above the underflow
    threshold, find x such that (1+x)*C > C. Try x = 1 ulp,
    but back off to B ulps of one. C is large enough that
    underflow is not an issue, but if multiplication
    lacks a guard digit, a single ulp might be lost.

    Returns:
        1 or B ulps of one
