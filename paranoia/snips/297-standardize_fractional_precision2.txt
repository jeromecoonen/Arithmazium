    # Intuitively, ulp = b**(-precisioon), so the negative of the
    # ratio of the logs retrieves the precision. But there may be
    # extra bits in octal or hex or even decimal, making up a partial
    # lowest-order digit. The factor 240 is a multiple of 8, 10, and
    # 16 with a bit extra. The value y rounds off noise from the logs.
    # TODO: resolve the apparent redundancy between the big factor 240
    # and the check for being with a quarter.
