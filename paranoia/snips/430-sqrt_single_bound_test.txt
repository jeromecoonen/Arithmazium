def sqrt_single_bound_test(tlist):
    """Test x = sqrt(x*x), raise error if not, and track max and min
    signed error in units of ulp.

    Uses an artful decomposition of x into xa + xb to facilitate test for
    equality.
    ***TODO: elaborate that this decomposition is exact -- because the values
    of x all have trailing 0s?

    Args:
        tlist - a list of tuples of:
            x - value to be tested
            ulp - 1/2 ulp of argument x
            error_kind - level of alarm to raise

    Returns:
        True if all tests pass, False otherwise
