def test_tiny_differences():
    """"With no gradual underflow, look for x != z but x-z = 0.
    This function is called after cases 1, 2, and 3 of underflow
    triage, where case 4 captures gradual underflow. The idea is
    to show how the nonzero differences between tiny numbers are
    not representable in the arithmetic.

    Usually, base_tiny == underflow_threshold but if it's smaller,
    then r * underflow_threshold is the geometric mean of the two.
    In the typical non-gradual-underflow cases when tiny_x and
    underflow_threshold differ by  a factor of 1 or H, the else
    clause below is taken.
