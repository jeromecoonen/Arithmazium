def tiny_values_and_difference(one_plus):
    """Compute the tiniest values from a starting value with nonzero
    low-order bits. This function is parallel to tiny_powers_of_B(),
    but looks for nonzero differences of tiny values, which are
    evidence of gradual underflow.

    If multiplication is too inaccurate, raise an error and return default
    values, shown in parens under Returns.

    Args:
        one_plus: 1 plus enough ulps that they shouldn't be lost when
            multiplied by a power of B
