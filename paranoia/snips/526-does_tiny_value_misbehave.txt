def does_tiny_value_misbehave(z):
    """Check for abnormal behavior of a value presumed
    to be tiny or zero.

    Given a value z, check that (z + z)/z is 2.0 or very close, and that
    1.0*z = z*1.0 = z/1.0 = z. This is especially interesting near the
    underflow threshold, but the function should work unless z is so
    huge that doubling it overflows.

    Args:
        z - test value

    Returns:
        boolean reply to the question
