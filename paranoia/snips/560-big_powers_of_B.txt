def big_powers_of_B():
    """Searching for the overflow threshold,
    return the NEGATIVES of the largest powers ofB.

    With a strategy similar to underflow, use three values in
    step to get up to and just beyond the overflow limit.

    Returns:
        bigger -- value that saturates like infinity or triggers an exception
        big -- down a factor of 1/H
        less_big -- down a factor of 1/H from big
        no_except -- boolean indicating no exception triggered

    Basic 5530-5530
    TODO: Resolve that we use negatives because of possible 2's complement
        representation, that could allow the largest magnitude to be
        negative.
