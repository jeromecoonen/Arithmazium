def no_trap_overflow_threshold(big, less_big):
    """ Determine the threshold when there is no trap on overflow.

    Typically, the search for the threshold will result in bigger_B and
    big_B pinned at Infinity or some huge finite value. Value less_big_B
    is guaranteed to be a finite, unexceptional value. This routine either
    returns big_B as a finite saturating value or fills out less_big_B
    with significant digits to reach right up to big_B.

    Args:
        big: power of 1/H that may be infinite or saturating finite value
        less_big: tame value a nominal factor of H smaller than big

    Returns:
        oflo: the overflow threshold
