# The two sets of tiny values characterize the underflow behavior.
# The following comments mirror BASIC comments 4530-4560. The relational ">~"
# may be loosely read "greater than or kind of equal to". It refers to the odd
# behavior of some arithmetics near 0, where some "pseudo zero" values behave
# like zero in some contexts and nonzero in others.
