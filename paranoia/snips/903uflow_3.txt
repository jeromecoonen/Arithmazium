# less_tiny_B and less_tiny_x result from similar loops, one starting
# with C, the other with (1 + SAFE_ULPS_OF_ONE) * C.
# Check to see who is the tiniest of them all, but scale up
# to avoid faulty comparisons as on CDC 6000.
# If the number encoding is such that what "looks like" the smallest power
# of the radix is interpreted as zero, then the smallest nonzero values
# will not be power of B. This test catches that case. The value h_fact
# records that the smallest power of B is too big by nearly a factor of H.
