# The Basic code switches on four cases depending on whether two values are
# zero or nonzero.
#   add_sub_tiny: the difference between two tiny unequal values may
#       underflow to zero
#   underflow_threshold: intended to be the smallest normal number
#       unaffected by underflow, but will not have been set yet for
#       arithmetic flushes underflow abruptly to zero
#
# -----------CASES----      4      3      2     1
#         add_sub_tiny    non0   non0     0     0
# underflow_threshold     non0     0    non0    0
#
# In high-quality arithmetic, both values are nonzero, so it's just a matter
# of checking for gradual underflow and its quality.
# If on the other hand, either value is zero, a specific action is taken and
# then all three cases fall into an explicit check for differences of zero
# arising from unequal values.
