The docstring sets the stage. We're looking for a value like this.

<p>
On some binary machines, the returned value might be a
factor of \(2\) too big, depending
on the rounding. This is just the first try.

#CODE 260-find_precision_big_B_nth

<p>
The loop proceeds as in the discussion in the digit diagrams here
and in the main code thread. Note the comparison here is against
\(1\), which Paranoia assumes to be reliable.

<div class="math">
<h2>What could go wrong?</h2>
<p>
This code will give
surprising results with log arithmetic. What seem like obvious
computations, such as addition of \(1\), are inexact,
so exact comparison against <code>ONE</code> is fraught with peril.
