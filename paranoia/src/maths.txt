<p>
Paranoia uses pseudonyms for its utility math functions,
so that any local naming conventions can be resolved within
these functions. The situation in <span class="p">ParaPy</span>

The <code>log()</code> function is the natural logarithm.
It always appears in the form
\( log(x) / log(b) \) to compute the log of \(x\) to the base \(b\).
