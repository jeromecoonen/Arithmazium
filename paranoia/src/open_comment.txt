<h1>Historical comment</h1>

<p>
The opening comment gives a summary of known ports
of Paranoia, as well as a drop box for questions
or suggestions for the code.
</p>

<p>
Within a few years of the appearance of classic
<span class="p">ParaBas</span>, Brian Wichmann of the
 National Physical Laboratory in the U.K. inspired a
 flurry of ports when he translated Paranoia from Basic
 to Pascal. His <span class="p">ParaPas</span> adheres
 closely to the structure of the Basic. Wichmann's intent
 was to test a new Pascal compiler at NPL.
</p>

<p>
The Pascal led naturally to a version in C by Thos Sumner
at the Data Center
of the University of California at San Francisco.
David M. Gay of Bell Labs also contributed to the port.
Some companies adapted
<span class="p">ParaC</span>
to run without user interaction as a
<em>smoke test</em> of systems in development.
During the course of such usage at Sun Microsystems,
David G. Hough made a number of minor fixes
to <span class="p">ParaC</span>.
The <code>hasty</code> flag in
<span class="p">ParaPy</span>
offers similar nonstop execution:
"Just the facts, ma'am."

If you explore the other versions, you'll find
error messages of the form
<code>Notify Karpinski!</code>
The late Richard Karpinski was a colleague of
Sumner at the UCSF Data Center, and an active
contributor to multiple IEEE standards efforts.
You are invited to send any such comments to
me at the address in the code comment.
