<h1>Versions of Paranoia</h1>

<p>
Since its release in 1982, Paranoia has enjoyed enthusiastic
migration to other popular languages. You can find them at
<a class="inline" href="http://www.netlib.org/" target="_blank">Netlib</a>,
the repository of mathematical software, papers, and databases.
</p>

<h2>What do you call it?</h2>
<p>
This discussion touches on several flavors of the Paranoia program.
Some shorthand will tidy up the discussion, with a distinctive style
to call attention to the reference to a specific version.
We'll use <span class="p">ParaBas</span> (<em>pair 'a bass</em>,
as they say in Wisconsin, you know) for the Basic version,
adapting the file extension for other versions
like <span class="p">ParaPy</span>, the focus of this discussion.
</p>

<h2>Basic</h2>
<p>
<span class="p">ParaBas</span> version
A1.10 by William Kahan, released May 1982, is
<a class="inline" href="https://netlib.org/paranoia/paranoia.b"
  target="_blank">here</a>
at Netlib, the repository of mathematical software, papers,
and databases.
</p>
<p>
Version A1.11 updated for this site in 2020, is
<a class="inline" href="paranoia_bas.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
The changes are small:
</p>
<nl>
  <li>Bump the version number in the introductory
    <code>PRINT</code> statement.</li>
  <li>Remove an unwanted <code>'</code> character in line 110.</li>
  <li>Reverse the inequality in line 5390, as explained in
    the Basic and Python.</li>
  <li>Change all instances of <code>&gt;&lt;</code> to
    <code>&lt;&gt;</code>, the more modern symbol for
    \( \ne \) in Basic.</li>
</nl>
<p>
The three new lines are comments, with distinctive line numbers
<code>xx3</code> and the initials JTC.
</p>

<p>
This is a fascinating body of code and you're encouraged to
have a look at it. Pro tip: a good place to start is
the bottom, where you will find a handy glossary of
the variables.
</p>

<h2>Pascal</h2>
<p>
Brian A. Wichmann of the National Physical Laboratory in Britain
re-coded Paranoia in Pascal in 1985,
with contributions by David M. Gay
and David G. Hough. You can find the 1988 edition
of <span class="p">ParaPas</span> on Netlib
<a class="inline" href="https://www.netlib.org/paranoia/paranoia.p"
  target="_blank">here</a>.
Wichimann used his version of Paranoia to test NPL's new Pascal compiler.
</p>

<h2>C</h2>
<p>
Thos Sumner of the University of California, San Francisco ported
<span class="p">ParaPas</span> to C in 1985,
with later help from Gay and Hough.
<span class="p">ParaC</span> 1992 is
<a class="inline" href="https://www.netlib.org/paranoia/paranoia.c"
  target="_blank">here</a> at Netlib.
Some users have modified <span class="p">ParaC</span>
from its interactive form to a command-line tool to be
used as a numerical sanity check in systems development.
</p>
<p>
Work on the Python version has revealed several bugs in the C version.
They should find their way to an update to the Netlib version,
eventually.
</p>

<h2>Fortran</h2>
<p>
Naturally, Paranoia has a Fortran edition. Or two.
Netlib has versions to be compiled for
<a class="inline" href="https://www.netlib.org/paranoia/spara.f"
  target="_blank">single precision</a> and
<a class="inline" href="https://www.netlib.org/paranoia/dpara.f"
  target="_blank">double precision</a>.
We refer to them together as <span class="p">ParaTran</span>.
</p>

<h2>Modula-2</h2>
<p>
Among the spate of early Paranoia codes is K. Y. Tan's port
of the Pascal version to Modula-2.
The 1986 edition of <span class="p">ParaMod</span> is
<a class="inline" href="https://www.netlib.org/paranoia/paranoia.m2"
  target="_blank">here</a> at Netlib.
</p>

<h2>Forth</h2>
<p>
Krishna Myneni ported <span class="p">ParaC</span> to
Forth-94 in 2009.
<span class="p">ParaForth</span> is not yet in Netlib, but
you can find it
<a class="inline"
  href="https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/programs/paranoia.fs"
  target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Python</h2>
<p>
I converted <span class="p">ParaC</span> to Python semi-automatically in 2019.
Like the <span class="p">ParaPas</span> and
<span class="p">ParaC</span>, it looked like a large Basic program
in sheep's clothing. It had many global variables, often recycled for
multiple uses, and few subprograms.
</p>
<p>
To exploit many excellent features of Python
and to make the program more readable, I completely restructured
Paranoia as a set of independent test functions called from a code
sequence mirroring Kahan's original Basic. Everything happens in the same
order, but in a more modular structure.
</p>
<p>
The next page explains how this discussion carves
<span class="p">ParaPy</span> up
to deal with it in bite-sized chunks.
To see the whole program, or just run it yourself, click
<a class="inline" href="paranoia_py.html" target="_blank">here</a>
on this site.
</p>
<p>
<span class="p">ParaPy</span> will find its way to Netlib when the dust
settles.
</p>

<h2>Julia</h2>
<p>
A clear next step is <span class="p">ParaJ</span>
in the Julia language. To be continued...
