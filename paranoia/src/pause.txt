<h1>Pause for user input</h1>

<p>
A hybrid <code>input()</code> function allows us to use
the <code>hasty</code> flag to speed through Paranoia
without a stop. The tests for \(1 / 0\) and \(0 / 0\) request
user permission to proceed. Some older machines would summarily
halt execution at either of those operations.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of Paranoia is to have the user follow along as
testing proceeds. The <code>pause()</code> function gives the
user the chance to catch up with the latest messages. It updates
the page number and milestone and prints a header for a new
"page" of output.
</p>

<p>
Pauses arise in the normal course of Paranoia, but may arise in some
exceptional circumstances too, such as \(x \times y \neq y \times x\).
This means slightly different page numbers and milestones can
be seen on different arithmetics.
