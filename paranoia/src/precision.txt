<h1>Precision</h1>

<p>
We discovered the radix by looping in search
of a carry into the <code>B</code>'s place of a large power of \(2\).
</p>

<p>
Now, we discover the precision – the number of significant
digits carried – by adding \(1\) to successive powers of
<code>B</code> until the addition finally triggers rounding.
The diagram looks the same in any radix. It's shown here
in binary.

<p>
The rounding arises when <code>B</code> is raised to the power that is the
precision of the number system. The code sidelines the case of
radix <code>1.0</code>, perhaps because of log
arithmetic.
Otherwise, we call
<a class="inline" href="find_precision_big_B_to_nth.html">
  <code>find_precision_big_B_to_nth()</code></a> to
loop on powers of <code>B</code> until adding <code>1.0</code> causes
no increase.
</p>

#CODE 735-precision

<p>
The <code>N</code> in <code>BIG_B_NTH</code> is the precision,
barring very anomalous rounding behavior.
This means that \(B ^ {-(N-1)}\) should be an ulp of <code>1.0</code>, and
\(B ^ {-N}\) should be an ulp of numbers just less than <code>1.0</code>.

We record these guesses for now and move on to further refinement.
