<h1>
Welcome to Paranoia: The Program!
</h1>

<p>
This is the story of a BASIC program designed to be run any
imaginable computer. Its goal is the discovery of how the
arithmetic behaves â€“ and misbehaves.
</p>

<p>
Prof. William Kahan of the University of California
at Berkeley developed Paranoia in the early 1980s
on an original IBM PC.
Paranoia became an instant cult classic in the numerical
community. Within years, translations to Pascal, C, Fortran,
and Modula 2 appeared.
</p>

<p>
The story is worth telling, and may you find it worth reading,
because Paranoia to this day has the highest concentration
of accessible arithmetic wizardry you'll find anywhere.
There will never be another code quite like it.
</p>

<p>
To bring the conversation up to the 21st century, I've recast Paranoia
in Python, where we have the luxury of variable names more descriptive than
<code>E9</code> and <code>U2</code>,
and no limit on commentary.
You will need no specific Python
knowledge to read this story,
but you might notice that another advantage of Python is its
clean form, uncluttered by braces and punctuation.
Passing familiarity with any programming language
will help, but this discussion explains what little of
Python you will need.
</p>

<p>
If you've seen other versions of Paranoia or if you're just
feeling lucky, you're welcome to dive
in anywhere to get a feel for the code. Paranoia's experiments are designed
to be independent, so you can understand what's happening without
digesting
the whole program.
</p>

<p>
Welcome, enjoy the story!
