<h1>
Welcome to Paranoia: The Program
</h1>

<p>
This is the story of a program from the early 1980s.
Paranoia runs on any computer supporting the BASIC language,
revealing the secrets of the computer's underlying arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
The story is worth telling, and may you find it worth reading,
because Paranoia has the highest concentration
of accessible arithmetic wizardry you'll find anywhere.
There will never be another code quite like it.
</p>

<p>
When it appeared, Paranoia
became an instant cult classic in the numerical
community. Translations to Pascal, C, FORTRAN,
and Modula-2 quickly appeared. (Let's agree on the mixed-case names
like Basic
and Fortran to go easier on the eyes.)
</p>

<p>
To bring the conversation up to the 21st century,
I've translated Paranoia to Python.
Gone are the restriction to variables like
<code>E9</code> and <code>U2</code> and
a limit on number of lines for comments.
</p>

<p>
You won't need deep Python
knowledge to read this story.
Python's clean form
allows you to focus on computation, not syntax.
Familiarity with any programming language
will help, but this discussion includes a section explaining
what little of Python you might need.
</p>

<p>
This presentation proceeds with several introductory pages
and and then the code itself, organized as a shallow hierarchy
of tests with supporting functions. Paranoia executes in one pass,
a sequence of largely independent experiments.
It's not at all a simple program,
but you can unravel bits and pieces
without digesting the whole code.
</p>

<p>
Of course, you're welcome to dive in anywhere,
if you've seen other versions of Paranoia or if you're just
feeling lucky.
</p>

<p>
Welcome, enjoy the story.
