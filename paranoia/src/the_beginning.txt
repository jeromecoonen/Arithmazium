Welcome to Paranoia: The Program!
</p>

<p>
This is the story of Prof. William Kahan's
BASIC program, developed in the early 1980s on an original IBM PC.
Paranoia became an instant cult-classic in the numerical
community because of its ability to tease out misbehavior at the edges
of computer arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
The story is worth telling, and may you find it worth reading,
because Paranoia to this day has the highest concentration
of accessible arithmetic wizardry you'll find anywhere.
There is no comparison.
</p>

<p>
To bring the conversation up to the 21st century, I've recast Paranoia
in Python, where we have the luxury of variable names more descriptive than
<code>U2</code> and no limit on commentary. But you will need no specific Python
knowledge to read this story. Passing familiarity with any programming language
will suffice.
</p>
<p>
The next pages set some the context, but of course you're welcome to dive
in anywhere to get a feel for the code. Paranoia's experiments are designed
to be independent, so you can understand what's happening without inhaling
the whole program.
</p>
<p>
Welcome, and good luck!
