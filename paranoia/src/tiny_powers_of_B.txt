<h1>tiny_powers_of_B()</h1>

<p>
  The Python comments this walk toward the underflow threshold and,
  ultimately, to zero by factors of the radix. The result is a triple – small,
  smaller, smallest – which
  reflects how murky matters can be for tiny numbers. These are all simple
  powers of the radix, so their trailing digits are all zero.

#CODE 520-tiny_powers_of_B

<p>
  The diagram below captures the action in binary as <code>tiny</code>
  reaches the smallest
  normal number. It’s the value with full precision
  that has the smallest representable
  exponent. Value <code>z</code>, which is half that,
  is exactly representable as a subnormal
  on an IEEE 754 system. On most other machines, <code>z</code> flushes
  to zero, terminating
  the loop.

<p>
  With subnormal numbers, <code>tiny</code>
  reaches the tiniest representable
  value, as <code>z</code> underflows to zero.
  It is the first inexact result returned. Can
  you see that decimal arithmetic compatible with
  IEEE 754 2019 would behave the
  same way, with division by 10 at each step?

  The termination criterion
</p>

<pre><code>if (tiny_delta <= z) or (z + z <= z):</code></pre>

<p>
  detects several conditions:
  <ul>
    <li><code>z</code> pins at a tiny nonzero number,
      never underflowing to zero</li>
    <li><code>z</code> reaches zero</li>
    <li><code>z</code> underflows to a nonzero <em>epsilon</em> value,
      named for the Greek letter &epsilon;;
      epsilons are featured in a section of their own
  </ul>
</p>

  [Epsilons are introduced elsewhere.

  SUGGESTION: Add a <code>verbose</code> flag to the code, controlling extra output,
  such as is given here. Such additions to original Paranoia output are marked
  by “***”.  The original code reflected the era, restricting output to 80
  columns by 24 rows, enabling users to take screen shots.]
