<h1>tiny_values_and_difference()</h1>

<p>
  This function explores tiny values with nonzero low-order digits, and it
  looks at the differences between them. The loop has two layers, skipping over
  the inner layer as soon as the difference between tiny values
  fails the test
</p>

#CODE 522-tiny_values_and_difference

<pre><code>if (tiny_delta + tiny_delta) &lt;= tiny_delta:</code></pre>

<p>
  which says <code>tiny_delta</code> has taken a nonzero and non-ùõú value.
  This indicates that there isome loss of information due to underflow.
</p>

<p>
  While <code>too_tiny</code> is in the range of normal numbers,
  <code>tinier</code> scales back to <code>tiny</code>
  by <code>1/H</code> exactly.
  The next diagram shows the situation in binary in the typical case
  that multiplication is accurate enough that a single unit in the last place
  will detect differences between two nearly similar values after scaling by
  <code>1/H</code>.

<p>
  If <code>too_tiny</code> underflows to zero,
  the loop ends with <code>tiny_delta</code> still zero.
  But with any form of gradual underflow, the loss of precision is detected.
  Depending on the design of the arithmetic and which mode of rounding is
  selected, the low-order bit of <code>tinier</code> may be 0 or 1.
  This explains the use of
  the absolute value in computing <code>tiny_delta</code>.

<p>
  The code sets the underflow threshold value to tiny the first time this
  behavior is discovered.

  that it falls back to default values.]</em>
