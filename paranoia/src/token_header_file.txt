<h1>Introduction to the program</h1>

<p>
Prof. William Kahan of the
University of California at Berkeley
designed Paranoia to test the behavior
of a computer's floating point arithmetic.
With the user providing no more than <code>return</code>
keystrokes when prompted, Paranoia reports its findings
on standard output.
</p>

<p>
Paranoia's analysis is intended to help programmers porting a numerical code
from one computer to another. The artful tests arise from decades of
experience on mainframes and minicomputers.
Computers designed before 1980 exhibited a wide range of
different flavors of floating point.
By the time Paranoia appeared in 1982, the
effort to develop IEEE Standard 754 for floating point arithmetic was already
well underway. Today, the task of porting numerical programs is far less
onerous than it was four decades earlier.
</p>

<p>
In 2020, Paranoia may be more interesting to <em>read</em> than to run,
but it will detect some deviations from 754-conforming arithmetic,
and it may be useful on custom architectures not intended to support
the standard.
</p>

<p>
To run Paranoia, execute the single file <code>paranoia.py</code>.
The classic Basic version, <span class="p">ParaBas</span>,
treated its output device as a <em>glass tty</em>, printing results
in \(24 \times 80\) chunks. <span class="p">ParaPy</span> produces
output fit for a modern scrolling window.
</p>

<p>
The first lines of the the file indicate you should use some version
of Python 3. <span class="p">ParaPy</span> does not dip into
Python exotica, but it does rely on some v. 3 features.
There are two <code>import</code> statements.
The <code>math</code> <em>module</em> gives access to useful mathematical
functions like \(log(x)\) and \(floor(x)\).
The <code>division</code> import is an idiom
regarding integer division; it's good Python practice, but not essential
for Paranoia.
</p>

#CODE 090-token_header_file

<p>
At highest level, <code>paranoia.py</code> is a sequence of four
chunks:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Opening comments</li>
  <li>Initialization of global variables</li>
  <li>Support functions</li>
  <li>One-pass sequence of tests</li>
</ol>

<p>
This presentation proceeds in approximate execution order, following the
sequence of tests, with reference to the many support functions as
they are invoked.
