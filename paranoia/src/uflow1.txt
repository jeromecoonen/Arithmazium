<h1>Underflow tests</h1>

<div><p>
  Much ado about almost nothing is one way to characterize the historical
  treatment of tiny values in floating point arithmetic. It has been far the most
  hotly debated topic in the IEEE 754 committees. This section of Paranoia
  investigates the behavior of arithmetic on tiny values. But this is a brief
  history. It tells the story of underflow through Paranoia’s exploration. It
  leaves the more complete discussion to pages dedicated to the topic. Background

  where  is the radix and the  are digits in that radix. The exponent  is bounded
  by the limitations of the representation of the number format. The exponent
  usually falls in a simple range, such as [–126, 127] for IEEE 754 single format.
  Some arithmetics will sacrifice significant digits to extend the exponent range
  as values get huge or small. IEEE 754 supports gradual underflow, allowing the
  leading digits in the expression above to become 0, thereby supporting smaller
  and smaller values all with the same exponent . There are more extreme designs,
  extending the representation as needed to support an exponent of any conceivable
  size.

  Paranoia features many loops that terminate when a magnitude shrinks to zero or
  to a tiny epsilon value that remains the same when doubled. Faced with
  arithmetic that will not underflow, automatically extending the range to within
  the limits of the host computer, Paranoia will loop without end. The code The
  underflow investigation opens with a deceptively simple message about the
  objects of the search:

  <ul>
    <li>
      the underflow threshold – the smallest positive value
      that exhibits no surprises in arithmetic
    </li>
    <li>
      the smallest nonzero value – the
      smallest positive value discovered, though it may behave badly in some
      operations; for example, <code>100 * z</code> may result in zero
      even though <code>z != 0.0</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      an underflowed
      value – a computed result so tiny it has underflowed,
      usually to zero The
      various tests print messages along the way,
      especially when they discover
      anomalies.

  The diagram below illustrates the three values as will be discovered
  in arithmetic
  compliant with IEEE 754. The two nonzero values have the minimum exponent for
  the number format.

  Paranoia starts with powers of the radix. See the discussion of
  <code>tiny_powers_of_B()</code> for details about the triple of
  returned values. Typically,
  <code>too_tiny_B</code> has underflowed to zero.
  A description of H and C can be found in the
  discussion of the fundamental constants of the arithmetic.
