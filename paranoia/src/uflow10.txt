  The underflow analysis closes with a message about the underflow threshold and
  two final tests. Paranoia looks for an exponent range thatâ€™s too narrow relative
  to the precision, and tries to compute a value way below the underflow
  threshold.

<p>
  The next sections discuss the utility functions that support the underflow
  exploration. Much of this logic is in-line in the Basic code,
  often very tersely
  so, but the program is more malleable and readable when
  discussed in natural blocks.
