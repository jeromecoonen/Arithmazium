<h1>The underflow search values explained</ph1>

<p>
  The next big comment puts the two sets of tiny values in context. Paranoia
  introduces the concept of pseudo zero, for values that compare unequal to zero
  yet may behave like zero in some operations. The Control Data CDC 6000 series of
  machines had such tiny, seemingly nonzero values that infallibly behaved like
  zero in multiplication and division. They were encoded with the smallest
  representable exponent – the same exponent as true zero – so the designers saved
  a bit of hardware by simply treating all such numbers as zero during
  multiplication and division. They behaved correctly in addition and subtraction.
  This flaw lived on into Cray supercomputers, too.

  here, evenœpolitely.]</em>

<p>After the comment, the call to <code>test_for_pseudo_zero()</code> is made strictly for the side effect.
