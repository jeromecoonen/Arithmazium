<h1>Underflow tests with scaling</h1>

<p>
  In order to compare the tiny values from two sources,
  Paranoia scales the values
  up by a large power of the radix. This defends against faulty comparisons,
  again
  on the CDD 6000 class. In this case, the values are not so small that they
  behave like zero in multiplication,
  but they do all compare equal to each other.
