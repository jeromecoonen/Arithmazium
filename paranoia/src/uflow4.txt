<h1>Are there smaller values than powers of the radix?</h1>

<p>
  The next test is more subtle. It asks whether the difference between two tiny
  values can be a number smaller than values reached by just scaling by powers of
  the radix.

  <em>[QUESTION: Is “Products underflow at a higher threshold…” really a correct
  report? What’s being compared are two different beasts: one is a simple
  scaled-down value while the other is the nonzero difference between two such
  values. It is interesting that we can obtain a smaller value from a difference
  than from a product, but to talk about the underflow threshold, we should talk
  about the values producing the difference.]</em>
