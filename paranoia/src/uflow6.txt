<h1>The triage of underflow cases</h1>

<p>
  The next comment explains the division into
  four classes of arithmetic, relative
  to underflow.
  Value add_sub_tiny is nonzero when the arithmetic supports tiny,
  usually unnormalized, values.
  This is the case in arithmetic compliant with IEEE
  754. Value underflow_threshold is set thus far by the call to
  tiny_values_and_difference(). It is zero if the arithmetic flushes underflowed
  values to zero, so Paranoia will set it as needed. It is nonzero when the
  arithmetic has a well-defined, usually normalized, value below which the
  arithmetic degrades to nonzero values, with some loss of precision.
