<h1>Case 4</h1>

<p>
  Paranoia in Python skips the cases and tests the values directly. Case 4
  includes IEEE 754 arithmetic. In the elaborate compound test below, add_sub_hi
  is the value below which precision degrades, so it must match the computed
  underflow_threshold. Similarly, the tiniest difference should match the smallest
  nonzero value detected. The key to the third expression is the ratio
  add_sub_tiny / SAFE_ULPS_OF_ONE, which should match underflow_threshold.

<p>
  <em>[QUESTION: Why isn’t that test for zero? Is this just a “tiny enough” idiom,
  which is safer than testing for true zero?]</em>
