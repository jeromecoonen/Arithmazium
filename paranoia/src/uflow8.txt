<h1>Cases 3 and 2</h1>

<p>
  Case 3 falls through without comment to a final test. Its nonzero
  underflow_threshold indicates that it underflows to nonzero values, but the
  arithmetic is unable to represent the differences, so add_sub_hi is zero.
</p>

<p>
  Case 2 is anomalous, as the messages indicate, because very tiny values compare
  equal yet donâ€™t subtract to zero. Value underflow_threshold is set to a tiny
  value known to behave well and below which the arithmetic misbehaves.
