Paranoia grew out of experience with mainframe computers of the 50s, 60s,
and 70s, with minicomputers joining the party in the last decade.
In that era, designs – and misbehaviors – varied widely from machine to
machine, even from one manufacturer.

Writing programs intended to run across a variety of computers was
next to impossible. Programming language features were not yet standardized,
and the situation with the underlying arithmetics was worse. Values on one
machine might be too large or too small to represent on another. One machine
might lack enough significant digits in its number system to carry out
a computation correctly. Then there all the surprising behaviors, such
as \(x \times y \ne y \times x\) for unexceptional values \(x\) and \(y\).
