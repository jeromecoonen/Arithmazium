  Much ado about almost nothing is one way to characterize the historical
  treatment of tiny values in floating point arithmetic. It has been far the most
  hotly debated topic in the IEEE 754 committees. This section of Paranoia
  investigates the behavior of arithmetic on tiny values. But this is a brief
  history. It tells the story of underflow through Paranoia’s exploration. It
  leaves the more complete discussion to pages dedicated to the topic. Background
  As values get tinier and tinier, perhaps by successive division by 2,

  where  is the radix and the  are digits in that radix. The exponent  is bounded
  by the limitations of the representation of the number format. The exponent
  usually falls in a simple range, such as [–126, 127] for IEEE 754 single format.
  Some arithmetics will sacrifice significant digits to extend the exponent range
  as values get huge or small. IEEE 754 supports gradual underflow, allowing the
  leading digits in the expression above to become 0, thereby supporting smaller
  and smaller values all with the same exponent . There are more extreme designs,
  extending the representation as needed to support an exponent of any conceivable
  size.
</p>

<p>
  Paranoia features many loops that terminate when a magnitude shrinks to zero or
  to a tiny epsilon value that remains the same when doubled. Faced with
  arithmetic that will not underflow, automatically extending the range to within
  the limits of the host computer, Paranoia will loop without end. The code The
  underflow investigation opens with a deceptively simple message about the
  objects of the search:

  <ul>
    <li>
      the underflow threshold – the smallest positive value
      that exhibits no surprises in arithmetic
    </li>
    <li>
      the smallest nonzero value – the
      smallest positive value discovered, though it may behave badly in some
      operations; for example, <code>100 * z</code> may result in zero
      even though <code>z != 0.0</code>
    </li>
    <li>
      an underflowed
      value – a computed result so tiny it has underflowed,
      usually to zero The
      various tests print messages along the way,
      especially when they discover
      anomalies.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>


<p>
  The diagram below illustrates the three values as will be discovered
  in arithmetic
  compliant with IEEE 754. The two nonzero values have the minimum exponent for
  the number format.

</p>

<p>
  Paranoia starts with powers of the radix. See the discussion of
  <code>tiny_powers_of_B()</code> for details about the triple of
  returned values. Typically,
  <code>too_tiny_B</code> has underflowed to zero.
  A description of H and C can be found in the
  discussion of the fundamental constants of the arithmetic.

# Starts at Basic 4330
print("Seeking three values related to Underflow:")
print("    underflow_threshold = smallest well-behaved value")
print("    min_positive = smallest nonzero value discovered")
print("    too_tiny_x = a value underflowed to zero or a pseudo-zero")
# First step: compute tiny powers of the radix. H and C are two useful
# constants.
# H = min(1/B, 1/2); ONE_OVER_H = max(B, 2)
# C = 1/B**k, not too close to the underflow thereshold; ONE_OVER_C = B**k
less_tiny_B, tiny_B, too_tiny_B = tiny_powers_of_B(C)
</code></pre>

<p>
  Powers of the radix don’t tell the whole story, so Paranoia computes a parallel
  set of tiny values with nonzero low-order digits. Just adding a useful number of
  units in the last place is a challenge, so read about SAFE_ULPS_OF_ONE in the
  section on constants. The function tiny_values_and_difference(), returns seven
  values to be used in the following tests. They are explained in the discussion
  of the function.
<p/>

<pre><code># Constant SAFE_ULPS_OF_ONE = B OR 1 * ULP_OF_ONE_PLUS should have
# enough units in the last place of 1 to leave something nonzero
# in multiplication, even if there's no guard digit.
one_plus_safe = ONE + SAFE_ULPS_OF_ONE

# Compute a rich set of values analogous to the tiniest powers of B, but with
# nonzero low-order bits and attention to the differences of small values.
(less_tiny_x, tiny_x, too_tiny_x, underflow_threshold, add_sub_tiny,
 add_sub_hi, add_sub_lo) = tiny_values_and_difference(one_plus_safe)
</code></pre>

<p>
  The next big comment puts the two sets of tiny values in context. Paranoia
  introduces the concept of pseudo zero, for values that compare unequal to zero
  yet may behave like zero in some operations. The Control Data CDC 6000 series of
  machines had such tiny, seemingly nonzero values that infallibly behaved like
  zero in multiplication and division. They were encoded with the smallest
  representable exponent – the same exponent as true zero – so the designers saved
  a bit of hardware by simply treating all such numbers as zero during
  multiplication and division. They behaved correctly in addition and subtraction.
  This flaw lived on into Cray supercomputers, too.
</p>

<p>
  <em>[Insert Jamie Sethian example. Ponder whether to libel Seymour Cray
  here, evenœpolitely.]</em>
</p>

<p>After the comment, the call to test_for_pseudo_zero() is made strictly for the side effect.

<pre><code># The two sets of tiny values characterize the underflow behavior.
# The following comments mirror Basic comments 4530-4560. The relational ">~"
# may be loosely read "greater than or kind of equal to". It refers to the odd

# like zero in some contexts and nonzero in others.

#       add_sub_tiny <- |(x*H)/H - x| > 0 else add_sub_hi = less_tiny_x
test_for_pseudo_zero(too_tiny_x)
</code></pre>

<p>
  In order to compare the tiny values from two sources,
  Paranoia scales the values
  up by a large power of the radix. This defends against faulty comparisons,
  again
  on the CDD 6000 class. In this case, the values are not so small that they
  behave like zero in multiplication,
  but they do all compare equal to each other.
</p>

<pre><code>milestone = 120   #==============================
# less_tiny_B and less_tiny_x result from similar loops, one starting
# with C, the other with (1 + SAFE_ULPS_OF_ONE) * C.
# Check to see who is the tiniest of them all, but scale up
# to avoid faulty comparisons as on CDC 6000.
# If the number encoding is such that what "looks like" the smallest power
# of the radix is interpreted as zero, then the smallest nonzero values
# will not be power of B. This test catches that case. The value h_fact
# records that the smallest power of B is too big by nearly a factor of H.
if ONE_OVER_C * less_tiny_B > ONE_OVER_C * less_tiny_x:
    h_fact = H
    min_positive = tiny_x
else:
    h_fact = ONE
    min_positive = tiny_B
</code></pre>

<p>
  The next test is more subtle. It asks whether the difference between two tiny
  values can be a number smaller than values reached by just scaling by powers of
  the radix.
</p>

<p>
  <em>[QUESTION: Is “Products underflow at a higher threshold…” really a correct
  report? What’s being compared are two different beasts: one is a simple
  scaled-down value while the other is the nonzero difference between two such
  values. It is interesting that we can obtain a smaller value from a difference
  than from a product, but to talk about the underflow threshold, we should talk
  about the values producing the difference.]</em>

<p>
  Paranoia sets a reliable value base_iny which is used in the summary of
  arithmetic without gradual underflow. The utility does_tiny_value_misbehave()
  gives some assurance of a well-behaved value.
</p>

<pre><code># Now consolidate the three triples of tiny results into the values
# from the loop computation. Break into several cases...
# This defines base_tiny, which may be needed as a final result in some
# anomalous arithmetics.

</code></pre>

<p>
  The next comment explains the division into
  four classes of arithmetic, relative
  to underflow.
  Value add_sub_tiny is nonzero when the arithmetic supports tiny,
  usually unnormalized, values.
  This is the case in arithmetic compliant with IEEE
  754. Value underflow_threshold is set thus far by the call to
  tiny_values_and_difference(). It is zero if the arithmetic flushes underflowed
  values to zero, so Paranoia will set it as needed. It is nonzero when the
  arithmetic has a well-defined, usually normalized, value below which the
  arithmetic degrades to nonzero values, with some loss of precision.
</p>

<p>
  <em>[TODO: give examples of all four.]</em>
</p>

<pre><code># The Basic code switches on four cases depending on whether two values are
# zero or nonzero.
#   add_sub_tiny -- the difference between two tiny unequal values may
#       underflow to zero
#   underflow_threshold -- intended to be the smallest normal number
#       unaffected by underflow, but will not have been set yet for
#       arithmetic flushes underflow abruptly to zero
#
# -----------CASES----      4      3      2     1
#         add_sub_tiny    non0   non0     0     0
# underflow_threshold     non0     0    non0    0
#
# In high-quality arithmetic, both values are nonzero, so it's just a matter
# of checking for gradual underflow and its quality.
# If on the other hand, either value is zero, a specific action is taken and
# then all three cases fall into an explicit check for differences of zero
# arising from unequal values.
</code></pre>

<p>
  Paranoia in Python skips the cases and tests the values directly. Case 4
  includes IEEE 754 arithmetic. In the elaborate compound test below, add_sub_hi
  is the value below which precision degrades, so it must match the computed
  underflow_threshold. Similarly, the tiniest difference should match the smallest
  nonzero value detected. The key to the third expression is the ratio
  add_sub_tiny / SAFE_ULPS_OF_ONE, which should match underflow_threshold.
</p>

<p>
  <em>[QUESTION: Why isn’t that test for zero? Is this just a “tiny enough” idiom,
  which is safer than testing for true zero?]</em>
</p>

<pre><code>if add_sub_tiny and underflow_threshold:
    # Basic case 4
    if ((add_sub_hi == underflow_threshold) and (add_sub_tiny == min_positive)
            and (FABS( underflow_threshold - add_sub_tiny / SAFE_ULPS_OF_ONE)
                 <= add_sub_tiny)):
        flags["IEEE"] = is_gradual_underflow_IEEE(min_positive)
</code></pre>

<p>
  Case 3 falls through without comment to a final test. Its nonzero
  underflow_threshold indicates that it underflows to nonzero values, but the
  arithmetic is unable to represent the differences, so add_sub_hi is zero.
</p>

<p>
  Case 2 is anomalous, as the messages indicate, because very tiny values compare
  equal yet don’t subtract to zero. Value underflow_threshold is set to a tiny
  value known to behave well and below which the arithmetic misbehaves.

<p>
  Case 1 arises in arithmetic that flushes underflows to zero. The comment
  explains that the underflow threshold is backed up to the next power of B if the
  computation of add_sub_hi cannot be reproduced, indicating some anomaly.

  unequal values are zero. It applies to all of cases 1-3.

  The underflow analysis closes with a message about the underflow threshold and

  The next sections discuss the utility functions that support the underflow
  exploration. Much of this logic is in-line in the Basic code,
  often very tersely
  so, but the program is more malleable and readable when
  discussed in natural blocks.
