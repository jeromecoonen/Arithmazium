<h1>What is Paranoia?</h1>

<p>
Prof. William Kahan of the University of California
at Berkeley developed Paranoia in standard Basic
on the original
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer">IBM PC</a>,
a product of
IBM's development office in Boca Raton, Florida.
</p>

<p>
Paranoia arose from Kahan's
experience with computers ranging from the earliest
commercial mainframes of the 50s to
the minicomputers in the 70s.
For thirty years, Kahan had worked with colleagues at Toronto,
Cambridge, Urbana-Champaign, Stanford, and Berkeley to understand
why innocent-looking mathematical algorithms often failed so miserably.
Most of the codes he studied were in Fortran, the era's
language of science and engineering,
but he chose standard Basic for Paranoia.
He wanted it to run anywhere with minimal change,
including new microprocessor-powered machines just
starting to multiply.
</p>

<p>
It's one thing to home in anomalies like a value that changes
slightly when multiplied by \( 1.0 \) or a value that behaves
like zero despite comparing not equal to zero. Programmers find these
problems and fix them, or they discover strategies to just avoid
them. Such strategies contribute to the lore of mystery around
numerical computation.
</p>

<p>
It's another matter to port a working program from one computer
to another with completely different arithmetic.
As explored in the <a href="../aaadinosaur_toc.html">Dinosaur Gallery</a>,
designs varied widely even across a single manufacturer's product lines.
This is the challenge Kahan had in mind when he wrote Paranoia.
</p>

<p>
The programmer's dilemma is not obvious.
In everyday affairs, arithmetic is arithmetic,
backed by mathematical principles we learn at an early age.
But computer users and programmers at all levels of exposure
know there's something suspicious about computer arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
Computers support <em>floating point</em> arithmetic, which is explored
throughout this site. We have all experienced variations of floating point
in some form.
We use <em>scientific notation</em> in school to represent Avogadro's Number
\(6.02252 \times 10^{23} \) and we see the condensed form
<code>6.02252E23</code> on pocket calculators.
This is a decimal representation, convenient for human use.
Computers may use bninary <code>0..1</code>,
octal <code>0..7</code>, or
hexadecimal <code>0..9A..F</code>
digits, scaled by
\( 2^{k} \), \( 8^{k} \), or \( 16^{k} \), respectively.
The decimal point becomes a <em>radix point</em>, and places
to the right are powers of a half, an eighth, or a sixteenth.
</p>

<p>
This site is devoted to exposing the
subtleties of arithmetic, tracing anomalies back to the earliest
machines and trying to collect the ideas that will play into
designs of the next decades.
</p>

<p>
Paranoia's job in 1982 was to psyche out a machine's arithmetic.
Here is a list of some of the questions explored:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Is the arithmetic binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal,
      or even logarithmic?
    </li>
    <li>
      How many significant digits in the radix 2, 8, 10, or 16 are carried?
    <li>
      Are excess digits in a result truncated,
      rounded off, or something else?
    </li>
    <li>
      What is the largest finite number? The smallest number?
      Do the extreme values have any unusual behaviors in arithmetic?
    </li>
    <li>
      How accurate are \( \sqrt{x} \) and \( y ^ {z} \)?
    </li>
    <li>
      Does the arithmetic behave according the then-emerging
      IEEE floating point standard?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
The final question refers to
IEEE Standard 754 for Floating Point
Arithmetic. The standard was formally approved in 1984, after Paranoia's
introduction, but its development dated from 1978.
Paranoia arrived just as the world was about to improve dramatically
for numerical programmers.
</p>

<p>
Paranoia's job was to characterize the arithmetic on a computer,
so that programmers porting code from
one computer to another would have some idea of the
numerical challenges they faced.
In principle, a programmer would run Paranoia just once on each machine
in question, then devise a strategy for modifying what worked in one
place to work in the next.
