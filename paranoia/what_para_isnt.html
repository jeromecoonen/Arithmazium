<h1>What Paranoia isn't</h1>

<p>
Paranoia diagnoses computer arithmetic, but it does not reverse
engineer the underlying architecture. Paranoia does not attempt
to discover the word sizes of values. It does not distinguish
ones'-complement, two's-complement, and sign-magnitude
representation of algebraic sign.
(Just the difference in the placement of the apostrophes above is enough
to make you suspicious.)
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, Paranoia does not inquire about the encoding of
values. Readers familiar with floating point arithmetic and the IEEE
standards know this a topic all its own. It's covered in
<a class="inline" href="../essentials/aaaessentials_toc.html">
Essentials</a>.
</p>

<p>
Paranoia concerns itself with commercially relevant computers,
so it does not look at any radix other than 2, 8, 10, or 16.
And by the year 2000, octal and hexadecimal systems were designs
of the past.
Paranoia discovers logarithmic arithmetic,
but the reporting is keyed to
floating point.
Log arithmetic appeared on
specialized machines years ago and has found some new
enthusiasts in the machine learning era.
</p>

<p>
Paranoia does not concern itself with the <em>bindings</em>
of arithmetic features to programming languages.
To be cast in standard Basic, and then ported to multiple
other languages, Paranoia necessarily uses few sophisticated
features. Aside from the basic four operations and comparisons,
Paranoia uses common functions like <code>abs()</code>,
<code>sqrt()</code>, <code>pow()</code>, and <code>log()</code>,
and it depends on printing values in decimal.
</p>

<p>
Paranoia tests that integer values behave reasonably in
scientific calculations,
but it does not test the limits of a system's integer arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
Paranoia provides a richer analysis than an earlier Fortran program,
<coee>MACHAR</code> by William J. Cody, which provided runtime parameters
to some library programs.
But Paranoia does not leap to the axiomatic approach,
such as in W. Stan Brown's paper
<em>A Simple but Realistic Model of Floating-Point Computation</em>.
Instead, Paranoia provides a specific set of findings
to inform a single software port from one computer to
another.
This is more tractable than a
port to a hypothetical design suffering the
sum of all numerical failings.
</p>

<p>
Finally, a word about architectures of the 2020s.
Paranoia diagnoses a system's arithmetic for use across the
panoply of scientific, engineering, financial, and student
applications. In the brave new world of graphics accelerators
and machine learning, highly parallelized custom processors
support specialized applications characterized by features like
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limited precision of about 2 or 3 decimal digits</li>
  <li>Limited dynamic range, perhaps \( 10^{\pm 5} \)</li>
  <li><em>Simplified</em> response to arithmetic overflow and underflow,
    which are expected not to be computationally significant</li>
  <li>No division operation</li>
  <li>Few conventional functions like <code>log()</code></li>
  <li>No general purpose programming</li>
</ul>
<p>
Paranoia does not necessarily ask the right questions for this
specialized realm, and it may require significant change to run
in such an environment.
